  <h1>CSE 210 - W01 Assignment: Explain Version Control</h1>

  <p><strong>What is version control and why is it important?</strong></p>

  <p>
    Version control is a system that helps track changes to code or documents over time. It allows developers to save snapshots of their work at different points, compare changes, and revert to earlier versions if something goes wrong. This is essential in software development because it helps teams collaborate efficiently without overwriting each other's code.
  </p>

  <p>
    One major benefit of version control is <strong>collaboration</strong>. Multiple developers can work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously, and later merge their changes safely. It also keeps a clear history of who made what changes and when, which is helpful for debugging and accountability.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, in a software development team working on a mobile app, one developer might be updating the login system while another is fixing layout issues. Using version control tools like Git, they can each create a separate branch for their work. Once they're done and the changes are tested, their code can be merged into the main branch.
  </p>

  <p>
    A common Git command used in version control is:
  </p>

  <pre><code>git commit -m "Add login validation"</code></pre>

  <p>
    This command saves the current changes to the local repository with a descriptive message, helping everyone understand what was changed and why. Overall, version control makes teamwork more organized and ensures the codebase remains stable as the project grows.
  </p>
