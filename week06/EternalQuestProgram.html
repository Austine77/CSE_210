  <h1>W06 Assignment: Explain Polymorphism</h1>

  <p><strong>Polymorphism</strong> is a principle in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different types to be treated through a common interface. In simple terms, it means using the same method name in different classes but implementing it differently in each class. This enables objects to respond in their own way to the same method call.</p>

  <p><strong>Why is it important?</strong> One key <strong>benefit</strong> of polymorphism is that it makes your code more flexible and maintainable. Instead of rewriting or overloading functionality, you can define a general interface in a base class and override it in subclasses. This reduces code duplication and allows you to add new features without modifying existing code.</p>

  <p><strong>Example from my code:</strong> In my Week 06 assignment, I created a base class called <code>Shape</code> with a method <code>get_area()</code>. I then created subclasses like <code>Rectangle</code> and <code>Circle</code>, each with their own implementation of <code>get_area()</code>. Here's the code example:</p>

  <pre><code>class Shape:
    def get_area(self):
        # This is a generic method to be overridden
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def get_area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def get_area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius

# Using polymorphism
shapes = [Rectangle(4, 5), Circle(3)]

for shape in shapes:
    print(shape.get_area())
</code></pre>

  <p>Even though each shape has a different formula for calculating area, I was able to loop through a list of shapes and call <code>get_area()</code> without knowing which specific shape it was. This is the power of polymorphism — writing generalized code that adapts to specific behavior automatically. It’s a key concept in designing clean, scalable applications.</p>
