  <h1>W06 Assignment: Explain Polymorphism</h1>

  <p><strong>Polymorphism</strong> is a core concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It means that the same method name can behave differently depending on the object that is calling it. This makes code more flexible and easier to maintain.</p>

  <p>A major <strong>benefit</strong> of polymorphism is that it allows you to write code that works on the <em>interface or base class</em>, while letting the <em>actual behavior</em> be defined in the <em>child classes</em>. This way, you can add new features or classes without changing the existing code structure, which follows the <strong>Open/Closed Principle</strong> (open for extension, closed for modification).</p>

  <p>In my Week 06 program, I created a base class called <code>Shape</code>, which had a method called <code>get_area()</code>. Then, I created different shapes like <code>Rectangle</code>, <code>Circle</code>, and <code>Triangle</code>, all of which inherited from <code>Shape</code>. Each subclass provided its own version of the <code>get_area()</code> method.</p>

  <p>Here’s an example of polymorphism in my program:</p>

  <pre><code>class Shape:
    def get_area(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
        
    def get_area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius
        
    def get_area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius

shapes = [Rectangle(4, 5), Circle(3)]

for shape in shapes:
    print(shape.get_area())
</code></pre>

  <p>Even though each shape has its own <code>get_area()</code> implementation, the loop calls the correct version depending on the object. This shows how <strong>polymorphism</strong> allows me to write <em>generalized code</em> that still works with specific behavior. It’s a powerful tool that I will definitely use in real-world projects.</p>
