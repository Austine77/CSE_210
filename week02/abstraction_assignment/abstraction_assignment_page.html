    <h1>W02 Assignment: Explain Abstraction</h1>
    <h2>Question: What is abstraction and why is it important?</h2>
    <p>
        Abstraction in programming is the process of hiding complex details and showing only the essential parts of an object or function.
        It allows developers to manage complexity by breaking down code into simpler, understandable components.
        Instead of worrying about how something works internally, we focus on what it does.
        This makes programs easier to read, write, and maintain.
    </p>
    <p>
        One major benefit of abstraction is <strong>code reusability</strong>.
        Once we write a function or class to perform a task, we can reuse it anywhere without rewriting the same logic.
        It also helps reduce errors because the logic is written once and tested.
    </p>
    <p>
        A real-world example of abstraction is a car.
        You press the brake pedal to stop, but you don’t need to know how the hydraulic system works.
        Similarly, in code, we call a function without knowing all its internal steps.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my program, I used a function to calculate the total price of items in a shopping cart:
    </p>
    <pre><code>def calculate_total(prices):
    return sum(prices)
</code></pre>
    <p>
        I used this function like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code>cart = [12.99, 5.49, 3.50]
total = calculate_total(cart)
print(f"Your total is ${total}")
</code></pre>
    <p>
        This function hides the logic of adding the prices.
        It simplifies the program and keeps the main code clean and readable.
        That’s the power of abstraction.
